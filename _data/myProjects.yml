- Project: Alien Invasion

  Language: Python | pygame

  Description: This project is my personal rendition on the classic alien invasion game. It is a multi-object program that utilizes pygame to draw objects
   to the screen. From there, these objects can be moved, detect collisions, and keep track of the current game level. I created the icons for the game using Ilustrator.
   I have plans to revisit this project to update visual assest as well as add random power ups!
