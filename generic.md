<p>Hello and welcome to my personal portfolio! My name is Chavi Parks and I'm a first-generation college
student born in Chicago, Il.<br/> I began my college career at the University of Northern Iowa where I pursued two bachelor's degrees and a certification. <strong>Communication</strong> was the first degree. Here, I learned to speak, present, write and cooperate within groups and organizations.
I pride myself on my ability to build meaningful relationships and present ideas effectivly. My
second degree is in <strong>interactive digital studies.</strong> The focus of this degree is in web developmnet and digital computation. Through this program I have gained the necessary tools to design, build, and improve digital systems. My understanding of data and programming languages have been expanded due to my cerification in <strong>computer science.</strong> Object oriented programing, data structures, and software archritecture are all focal points of this certification.</p>

<p>Outside of the classroom, I typiclly found myself paricipating in student organizations, working on
personal projects, or spending time with loved ones. Some of the student orgs I participated in include Entrepreneurship Club, Jumstart Orientation, and the Towers Acivites Board. Within these organizations I attended seminars, lead group discussions, organized activities, and coordinated campus events. If you'd like to know about some of the projects I've worked on, feel free to check out my Project tab that shows what I've been up to recently!</p>
