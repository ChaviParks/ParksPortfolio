<h3>Web developer internship </h3>
<blockquote>Executive summary that explains internship and provides enough information to allow the portfolio to stand alone with the reader. This is an overview of your major accomplishments that are marketable to an employer, rather than an exhaustive run-down of every little thing you did during the internship. It should be part bullet-point list, part narrative. The idea is that a busy executive can read it quickly and get a good understanding of your experience. </blockquote>
