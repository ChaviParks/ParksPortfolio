<h3>Web developer internship </h3>
<blockquote>Throughout my internship at Amperage, I have gained valuable skills and perspectives that are valuable in various technology fields, including web development and software engineering. Working closely with clients, I honed my ability to create digital pages that accurately reflect their brand identity, which allowed me to develop strong skills in user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design. 

I have also developed a keen eye for identifying and resolving issues related to programmed styling, which has helped me to develop strong debugging skills that I can carry with me throught my softwae career. 

In addition, my exposure to digital systems that protect and optimize existing websites gave me a good understanding of web security and performance optimization. By participating in department meetings, I have been able to stay up-to-date with the latest technology practices and learn how to effectively communicate with clients.

Overall, my internship at Amperage has provided me with a solid foundation of skills and experiences that I am confident I can leverage to excel in any technology position.</blockquote>

<p><span class="image left"><img src="assets/images/GCRF.png" alt="" /></span><h3>Quality Assurance</h3> In my initial weeks of website development I was responsible for quality assurance on a client's website. I utilized Trello to track and manage identified issues, systematically working to debug layout issues and integrate content supplied by the client.</p>
 

<p><span class="image right"><img src="assets/images/waverlyChildcare.png" alt="" /></span><h3>Webpage Design</h3>My first design project was working with<a href="https://waverlychildcare.org/caring-for-our-kids/">Waverly childcare</a>. I was tasked with creating a landing page using the Seed Prod website theme builder. My main objective was to bring the client's vision to life while adhering closely to the approved design, ensuring that the resulting landing page was both functional and visually appealing across both desktop and mobile platforms.</p>


<p><span class="image left"><img src="assets/images/Wickbuilder.png" alt="" /></span><h3>Website Expansion</h3> Presented here is an example of another webpage I built, this time using SiteOrigin. The webpage, which you can access <a href="https://www.wickbuildings.com/timeforwick/">here</a>, required the creation of new assets that aligned with the client's design specifications. To achieve this, I utilized various tools, including the provided software, Photoshop, and CSS, resulting in a successful outcome that met the client's desired vision. The image displayed shows the webpages's backend, demonstrating my ability to create a webpage from start to finish.</p>
 

<p><span class="image right"><img src="assets/images/Plugins.png" alt="" /></span><h3>Security and Optimization</h3>As I learned during my internship, securing a website is a crucial aspect of its success, as important as creating a great design. In my role, I worked on various client sites to install and update plugins that were responsible for enhancing website security and optimizing website performance. This was done with the aim of ensuring that only authorized personnel had access to the backend of client sites, and to provide our clients with peace of mind knowing that their websites were secure. Furthermore, we provided our clients with tools to analyze user data and improve their website's user experience (UX), emphasizing our commitment to enhancing both security and functionality.</p>
